# Subhoofer
 Sub enhancement inspired by a few Airwindows plugins

**Subhoofer** is a sub and bass enhancement plugin aimed at being a lightweight replacement for
other subharmonic generation plugins.

There is no UI coded, but your DAW should be able to generate one based off the parameters
provided. There are 6 parameters available to change.

## Parameters
● Subhoof - Drive for the generated sub - this subtle effect is meant to balance with
SubGain. Use your ears!

● SubGain - Gain for the sub layer signal

● TiltEQ - Tilt EQ with more weight/character to the bass side, values to the right bias
towards highs and values to the left bias towards the lows

● Lowpass - A lowpass filter that acts before the final output gain

● TiltFrq - The center frequency of the TiltEQ - use this to bias the EQ further when you
don’t want to mess with sub gain.

● OutGain - final output gain/reduction

This plugin was made possible thanks to Airwindows source code (and a few emails with questions). I
highly recommend supporting Chris https://www.airwindows.com/ , along with various forum postings
and advice from https://www.musicdsp.org/en/latest/ and mitxela’s tutorial
